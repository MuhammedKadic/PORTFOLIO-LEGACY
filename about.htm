      <p>My name is <em>Muhammed Kadic</em>, I am currently pursing my passion as a application web developer at <a href="#">Ranken Technical College</a>.
       I was born in Saint Louis, Missouri on May 17th 2001. As a kid I was super technical and loved to take things apart and learn how they worked.
        I got introduced to coding around the age of 13 whenever I started playing minecraft.
        Minecraft was my way of learning Java and using it to make mods and plugins for the community.
         This simple game drove my way for coding for many years I start learning other languages like JavaScript, Ruby, and python.
       My main reason to learn these languages was so I could start making nodejs applications without struggling. Once I started to work with nodejs
     I learned that the language was actually quite easy and started making card games and multiplayer games that I played by my self. These languages made me want
   to learn more and more day by day.</p>
